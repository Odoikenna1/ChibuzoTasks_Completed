/*
Write a function that returns the largest element in a list

Steps:
1: initialize variable
	- one for the array

	- the other for the max

2: create a for loop;
	- initialize index counter variable
	  (this will help you comb through every element 
	   of your array using their index number)

	- declare a true statement to activate the loop
	  (This will start the loop)

	- use an increment expression to increase the value of the index

3: inside the body of the loop:
	- use a selection statement (if) to perform an action if a certain condition is true

	- the objective here: is to check (at each iteration) if the element of each index
	  at each iteration is less that the first element in the max variable (array[0]) and
	  if so then the new element(index) will be stored as the new max. 

This sequence will be repeated until the last maximum value in the array is discovered and (Sout'd)displayed.

4: Sout the max
