Ask the user how many times they want the program to run and store the input as userNumOfInputs.

Initialize minNumber to the largest possible integer value and maxNumber to the smallest possible integer value.

Repeat userNumOfInputs times:
   Ask the user to input a number and store it as inputNumber.
   If inputNumber is smaller than minNumber(Max value), update minNumber to inputNumber.
   If inputNumber is greater than maxNumber(Min value), update maxNumber to inputNumber.

Print the smallest number (minNumber) and the largest number (maxNumber).


This program takes in user input and compares it to the Max value that can be stored in Integer type

if that input is smaller than the Max Value, the variable for the minValue is update as the the new 

maximum value to be compared with other inputs.

As the program runs, it checks every input from the user the and compares it to the new minvalue(Max value) 

and updates the container that hold the smallest and largest variables.

At the end of the program, all the largest and smallest values are printed.
