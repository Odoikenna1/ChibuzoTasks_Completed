initialize variables for:
numberOfZeros
positiveNumber
negativeNumber

ask how many times the user wants to repeatedly perform the input task

save the int value in a variable call it userInput

using a for loop:

initialize a counter variable with 0;

define a loop continous conditionion with a boolean (true) evalution saying userInput is greater than the counter
(so the program runs as long as that statement is true, until it becomes false)

set a condtion to count the amount of positive, negative and zero int inputs the user input; do this by incrementing the variable by 1 

use a selection statement to check if all or any input is zero 0


if all or any input is a positive number from 1 to 1 million

if all or any input is a negative number from -1 to 

-1 million
