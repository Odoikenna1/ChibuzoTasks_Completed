For Printing a table

Print the table header with column headings "a", "b", and "pow(a, b)".

For each row in the table:
   Initialize variable 'a' to the first value in the 'a' column (1 in this case).

    Initialize variable 'b' to the second value in the 'b' column (2 in this case).

    Calculate the result of raising 'a' to the power of 'b' using integer exponentiation and store it in 'pow'.

        - You can achieve this by implementing a custom integer exponentiation function or using repeated multiplication.

   Print 'a', 'b', and 'pow' separated by tabs or spaces as a row in the table.
     Move to the next line.
