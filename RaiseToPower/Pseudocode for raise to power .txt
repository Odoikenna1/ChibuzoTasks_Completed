initialize variables for input: 

	use variable names base and power to store first and second input

initialize variable for expontential value with a value of 1

prompt the user for to collect input for first and second integer values

useing a loop;

	define a loop continuation condition with a true boolean evaluation (specifically define your power to not be greater than zero)

	set an arithmetic operation within the body of the loop that will multiple the base by the expontential value

	use a decrement operator to have the value of the power reduced by one until the condition becomes false

print out your result at the end of the program
