Problem:

Write a program to calculate the sum of first 10 natural number.

Algorithm:

step 1

initialize your variable (naturalNumber) = 0;

Step 2

using a for loop;

	(intialize a variable (counter); set a condition: counter < number of times you  want the iteration to happen; use increment operation)

Step 3

Inside the body of the for loop add the counter value to the naturalNumber and assign the value to the naturalNumber

step 4

print out the naturalNumber
