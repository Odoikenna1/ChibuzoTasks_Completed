Prompt the user to enter an integer between 0 and 100.

Read the integer input from the user and store it as 'number'.

Initialize a variable 'sum' to 0 to store the sum of the digits.

While 'number' is greater than 0:

    Extract the rightmost digit of 'number' using the % (modulo) operator by 10 

    (the place value for the right most digit of a number is 10) and store it in a variable 'digit'.

    Add 'digit' to 'sum'.

    Update 'number' by dividing it by 10 using the / (integer division) operator.

 After the loop, 'sum' will contain the sum of all the digits in the original number.

 Print the sum of the digits.
